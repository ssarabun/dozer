        Dozer is a Java Bean to Java Bean mapper that recursively copies data from one object to another.
        Typically, these Java Beans will be of different complex types.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dozer supports simple property mapping, complex type mapping, bi-directional mapping, implicit-explicit
        mapping, as well as recursive mapping. This includes mapping collection attributes that also need mapping
        at the element level.
      </p>

      <h3>Dozer 5.4.0 is out <font size="-3" color="gray"> <i>12/01/2012</i></font></h3>
      <p>
        Release 5.4.0 is available for download. This is the first release after moving project to GitHub and already
        few new contributors have joined.
      </p>
      <p>

        For technical questions use <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dozer">StackOverflow</a>
        All issue tracking will be done here <a href="https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer/issues">GitHub</a>
        Old SourceForge Forums and Issue tracker will not be active anymore. They will be disabled once migration is finished.

      <h3>Dozer is on GitHub<font size="-3" color="gray"> <i>06/28/2012</i></font></h3>
        <p>
            After some inactivity period Dozer has finally moved to
            <a href="https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer/">GitHub</a>.
            Source code will be maintained there from now on. This transition is a huge step forward for the project
            as the barrier for contribution is significantly lower on GitHub compared to SourceForge.
            It is really easy to create a Pull request and merge it afterwards. Transition of the issue trackers
            and support forums will be performed as well. We are looking forward to accept contributions from
            developers in forms of patches and help on migration to GitHub. Write to buzdin at gmail if you are
            interested.

        This release contains bug fixes and feature requests, along with internal refactoring. Some new features
        include indexed mapping within deep mapping, improved support of Map backed properties, and configuration
        of auto string trimming.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most significant refactoring was around Map backed properties. The refactoring did not change the
        public Dozer API or the xml dtd, but if you are currently using the Map backed property features of Dozer
        please thoroughly regression test your system after upgrading to 4.0 to verify that any expected behavior
        remains unchanged for your specific use cases. We do have a good amount of unit tests around the Map backed
        property feature, but please let us know if you experience any issues after upgrading and we will do
        everything we can to resolve it soon as possible.
