    <section name="Statistics">
      <p>
        If you enable statistics, Dozer will collect a number of runtime mapping metrics. These statistics are
        global and can be accessed via the GlobalStatistics object. The statistics are also available via JMX.
        Dozer is distributed with a fully functional JMX DozerStatisticsControllerMBean.
      </p>
      <p>Based on our profiling numbers, the overhead of enabling statistics is roughly 3-5%.</p>
