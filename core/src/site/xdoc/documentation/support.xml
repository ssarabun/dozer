      <subsection name="Looking for support or want to propose an enhancement for the dozer Framework?">
        <p>
          For community support or dozer enhancement requests check out the
          <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/dozer-mapper">Google Group</a>
          . We value your enhancement suggestions and want to build something of value to the Java community. When
          submitting bug and feature requests, it is really helpful if you are able to submit a simplified unit
          test case(s) that reproduce the issue. We understand this is not possible for every request, but if you
          are able to submit a unit test it usually results in the request being implemented sooner.
